## Installing Scout iOS

Xcode 8 and Swift 2.3

Clone this repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/uw-it-aca/scout-ios
```
Copy the sample config
```
$ cd scout-ios
$ cd Scout
$ cp sample.scoutConfig.plist scoutConfig.plist
```

Change the scout_host based on the URL of your test build.

Open the __**.xcodeproj**__ that was created. This should be the file you use everyday to work within Xcode.
